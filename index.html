        <p>This website was created in honour of Gordon Andrews, exhibiting his work and influence on the history of design in Australia.
            Gordon Andrews (1914–2001) was an influential Australian designer whose work spanned multiple disciplines, including industrial design, graphic design, and exhibition design. He became recognised as a pivotal figure in shaping modern Australian visual culture, deeply interested in modernist principles, and his work often reflected a fusion of functionality and aesthetic innovation. He was particularly influenced by European and Scandinavian design movements, which he encountered during his travels. These experiences broadened his perspective and contributed to his reputation as a forward-thinking designer in Australia.</p>
