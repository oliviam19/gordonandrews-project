# Rationale
## u3280271

This website was developed to showcase the legacy, design philosophy, and work of influential Australian designer Gordon Andrews. The intent was to create a visually engaging, user-friendly, and responsive experience that explores his modernist approach and lasting impact on Australian design. Clean typefaces, bold graphics, and a refined, minimalist colour palette were thoughtfully chosen to reflect Andrews’ clarity and innovation, while appealing to the target audience of design enthusiasts and professionals.

# Prototype vs Final Product

The high-fidelity prototype, created in Figma, served as a blueprint throughout development in VSCode. While many elements remained consistent, such as the Home and Influence pages, others were refined during implementation. For example, I adjusted the About page on both versions of the site, as it lacked harmony and visual cohesiveness when viewed developed on full-screen. I re-edited the hero image with a red tint and changed the heading’s background to red for improved consistency.

I also completely redesigned the Work page on both mobile and desktop, as looking back over my original concept, I felt that I was not using space effectively and that I had missed an opportunity to challenge myself and include a more creative element. I am a lot more satisfied with my final layout for that page, and I believe it is far more effective and engaging for the user. Another adjustment made from the prototype was removing the "X" button from the opened hamburger menu page, as I decided that it was an unecessary distraction for the user, as they could simply return to their previous page by selecting it in the menu.

In creating this website, I wanted to learn something new and create a favicon. I found a simple tutorial on W3schools.com, that helped me achieve this.

For my revamped Work page, although the new concept was my own idea, I was unsure on how to implement it and achieve the concept that I wanted. I ended up asking GenAI the best methods of achieving this grid layout as a basis to work off of, as well as the best way to achieve the clicking effect on mobile and the hovering effect on desktop. I found this very helpful in terms of learning, as it gave me an informative base to experiment with.

## Overall Evaluation

Overall, I am satisfied with the end result of this project. Although there are some aspects thatcould definitely be improved, such as the scaling and positioning of elements when transitioning between screen sizes, I am proud of myself for what I've been able to design and create, as most of this was a learning experience. This process was largely trial and error, and learning by figuring out what works and what doesn't. This project allowed me to incorporate my existing skills and passions, such as logo design and image editing, whilst practising my problem-solving (a lot) and learning a large amount about responsive design.
